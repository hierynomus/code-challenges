    "You come upon a column of four floors that have been entirely sealed off from the rest of the building except for a small dedicated lobby. There are some radiation warnings and a big sign which reads \"Radioisotope Testing Facility\".\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the project status board, this facility is currently being used to experiment with Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs, or simply \"generators\") that are designed to be paired with specially-constructed microchips. Basically, an RTG is a highly radioactive rock that generates electricity through heat.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experimental RTGs have poor radiation containment, so they're dangerously radioactive. The chips are prototypes and don't have normal radiation shielding, but they do have the ability to **generate an electromagnetic radiation shield when powered**. Unfortunately, they can only be powered by their corresponding RTG. An RTG powering a microchip is still dangerous to other microchips.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if a chip is ever left in the same area as another RTG, and it's not connected to its own RTG, the chip will be **fried**. Therefore, it is assumed that you will follow procedure and keep chips connected to their corresponding RTG when they're in the same room, and away from other RTGs otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "These microchips sound very interesting and useful to your current activities, and you'd like to try to retrieve them. The fourth floor of the facility has an assembling machine which can make a self-contained, shielded computer for you to take with you - that is, if you can bring it all of the RTGs and microchips.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the radiation-shielded part of the facility (in which it's safe to have these pre-assembly RTGs), there is an elevator that can move between the four floors. Its capacity rating means it can carry at most yourself and two RTGs or microchips in any combination. (They're rigged to some heavy diagnostic equipment - the assembling machine will detach it for you.) As a security measure, the elevator will only function if it contains at least one RTG or microchip. The elevator always stops on each floor to recharge, and this takes long enough that the items within it and the items on that floor can irradiate each other. (You can prevent this if a Microchip and its Generator end up on the same floor in this way, as they can be connected while the elevator is recharging.)\n",

    "\n",
    "To generate keys, you first get a stream of random data by taking the MD5 of a pre-arranged salt (your puzzle input) and an increasing integer index (starting with `0`, and represented in decimal); the resulting MD5 hash should be represented as a string of **lowercase** hexadecimal digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not all of these MD5 hashes are **keys**, and you need 64 new keys for your one-time pad. A hash is a key **only if**:\n",

    "- It contains **three** of the same character in a row, like `777`. Only consider the first such triplet in a hash.\n",

    "Considering future hashes for five-of-a-kind sequences does not cause those hashes to be skipped; instead, regardless of whether the current hash is a key, always resume testing for keys starting with the very next hash.\n",

    "For example, if the pre-arranged salt is `abc`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first index which produces a triple is `18`, because the MD5 hash of `abc18` contains `...cc38887a5....` However, index 18 does not count as a key for your one-time pad, because none of the next thousand hashes (index `19` through index `1018`) contain `88888`.\n",
    "- The next index which produces a triple is `39`; the hash of `abc39` contains `eee`. It is also the first key: one of the next thousand hashes (the one at index `816`) contains `eeeee`.\n",
    "- None of the next six triples are keys, but the one after that, at index `92`, is: it contains `999` and index `200` contains `99999`.\n",

When a button is pressed, a capsule is dropped and tries to fall through slots in a set of rotating discs to finally go through a little hole at the bottom and come out of the sculpture. If any of the slots aren't aligned with the capsule as it passes, the capsule bounces off the disc and soars away. You feel compelled to get one of those capsules.\n",

    "Furthermore, the discs are spaced out so that after you push the button, one second elapses before the first disc is reached, and one second elapses as the capsule passes from one disc to the one below it. So, if you push the button at `time=100`, then the capsule reaches the top disc at `time=101`, the second disc at `time=102`, the third disc at `time=103`, and so on.\n",

    "You're done scanning this part of the network, but you've left traces of your presence. You need to overwrite some disks with random-looking data to cover your tracks and update the local security system with a new checksum for those disks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the data to not be suspicious, it needs to have certain properties; purely random data will be detected as tampering. To generate appropriate random data, you'll need to use a modified dragon curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with an appropriate initial state (your puzzle input). Then, so long as you don't have enough data yet to fill the disk, repeat the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Call the data you have at this point \"a\".\n",
    "- Make a copy of \"a\"; call this copy \"b\".\n",
    "- Reverse the order of the characters in \"b\".\n",
    "- In \"b\", replace all instances of `0` with `1` and all `1`s with `0`.\n",
    "- The resulting data is \"a\", then a single `0`, then \"b\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, after a single step of this process,\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1` becomes `100`.\n",
    "- `0` becomes `001`.\n",
    "- `11111` becomes `11111000000`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Repeat these steps until you have enough data to fill the desired disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data has been generated, you also need to create a checksum of that data. Calculate the checksum **only** for the data that fits on the disk, even if you generated more data than that in the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The checksum for some given data is created by considering each non-overlapping **pair** of characters in the input data. If the two characters match (`00` or `11`), the next checksum character is a `1`. If the characters do not match (`01` or `10`), the next checksum character is a `0`. This should produce a new string which is exactly half as long as the original. If the length of the checksum is **even**, repeat the process until you end up with a checksum with an **odd** length.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we want to fill a disk of length `12`, and when we finally generate a string of at least length `12`, the first `12` characters are `110010110100`. To generate its checksum:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider each pair: `11`, `00`, `10`, `11`, `01`, `00`.\n",
    "- These are same, same, different, same, different, same, producing `110101`.\n",
    "- The resulting string has length `6`, which is **even**, so we repeat the process.\n",
    "- The pairs are `11` (same), `01` (different), `01` (different).\n",
    "- This produces the checksum `100`, which has an **odd** length, so we stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the checksum for `110010110100` is `100`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining all of these steps together, suppose you want to fill a disk of length `20` using an initial state of `10000`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because `10000` is too short, we first use the modified dragon curve to make it longer.\n",
    "- After one round, it becomes `10000011110` (`11` characters), still too short.\n",
    "- After two rounds, it becomes `10000011110010000111110` (`23` characters), which is enough.\n",
    "- Since we only need `20`, but we have `23`, we get rid of all but the first `20` characters: `10000011110010000111`.\n",
    "- Next, we start calculating the checksum; after one round, we have `0111110101`, which `10` characters long (**even**), so we continue.\n",
    "- After two rounds, we have `01100`, which is `5` characters long (**odd**), so we are done.\n",

    "In this example, the correct checksum would therefore be `01100`.\n",

    "As you enter this room, you hear a loud click! Some of the tiles in the floor here seem to be pressure plates for traps, and the trap you just triggered has run out of... whatever it tried to do to you. You doubt you'll be so lucky next time.\n",

    "Upon closer examination, the traps and safe tiles in this room seem to follow a pattern. The tiles are arranged into rows that are all the same width; you take note of the safe tiles (`.`) and traps (`^`) in the first row (your puzzle input).\n",

Let's call these three tiles from the previous row the **left**, **center**, and **right** tiles, respectively. Then, a new tile is a trap only in one of the following situations:\n",

Because all of the trap rules require a trap in at least one of the previous three tiles, the first tile on this new row is also safe, `.`.\n",
    "- The second character on the next row considers its left (`.`), center (`.`), and right (`^`) tiles from the previous row. This matches the fourth rule: only the right tile is a trap. Therefore, the next tile in this new row is a trap, `^`.\n",
    "- The third character considers `.^^`, which matches the second trap rule: its center and right tiles are traps, but its left tile is not. Therefore, this tile is also a trap, `^`.\n",
    "- The last two characters in this new row match the first and third rules, respectively, and so they are both also traps, `^`.\n",
